Course - Human Computer Interaction (CS5340) 

Team : Her'd

Members : Keerthi Pendyala & Monisha Carol

Technology Used : MEAN stack 

Description : 

TA office hours are informal sessions where there can be an unexpected number of incoming students. A long queue of students can be overwhelming for a single TA and frustrating for students as well. The idea behind this application is to make the process better.

Students sign up for TA hours on the application before the sessions begin. While signing up for a session, students can also give a brief description of the question/problem they need help with so that TAs can be better prepared.

The system will have an interface each for student and TA. The student will book appointments and TAs will give their availability and be able to look at student questions in advance to prepare for the upcoming sessions. 

Setup:

1. cd HCI-Project
2. Open a terminal and run : npm install
3. Run: mongod
4. On a new terminal, cd into HCI-Project and run : node server.js
5. To login as student - Go to localhost:3000/project/#/home . To login as TA - Go to localhost:3000/project/#/taHome .
